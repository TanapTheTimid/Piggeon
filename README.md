# Piggeon
Piggeon 2D Game Engine - Hiding a pig behind a pigeon.

A simple, easy to use, beginner friendly, object oriented, two dimensional game engine written entirely in Java.
The design of this engine aims to hide away the ugliness of OpenGL and game loop implementation (the pig) behind a simple yet
extensible framework (the pigeon) with which beginner programmers may utilize to construct games without relying on the 
Swing or JavaFX libraries.

# Why make this engine?
There already exist multitudes of good, opensource game engines for Java, but the majority of those libraries 
can be extremely daunting for beginners. This engine does not require any knowledge of game loop mechanism, OpenGL calls,
matrix manipulation, image loading, or other scary stuff. It provides a model for creating GameObject(s) and Stage(s) that
are simple, yet extensible.

# Requirements
This project uses LWJGL graphics library, but LWJGL binaries are not bundled here. If you would like to build this project, download LWJGL separately.
